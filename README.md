## About This Repository 
The repository compiles projects and assignments from my Introduction to Data Vizualization with Tableau. 

## Topics/Concepts Learned 
1. Data preparation: Importing, integrating, and organizing datasets.
2. Visualization design: Building both basic and advanced charts for analysis.
3. Critical evaluation: Assessing and improving the effectiveness of visualizations.
4. Analytical techniques: Using calculated fields, table calculations, and level-of-detail (LOD) expressions.
5. Forecasting & modeling: Applying built-in Tableau tools for predictive insights.
6. Storytelling & dashboards: Creating interactive dashboards and narrative-driven visualizations.
7. Practice through cases: Applying these skills to real-world, case-based exercises.

## COVID-19 Data Analysis Project 
The COVID-19 CSV file and related Tableau workbooks were too large to be uploaded here, so the project has been [linked HERE on this README](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W6JPn0z8q-aFxaIxNdEau8-GialEr5aA/view?usp=sharing).
